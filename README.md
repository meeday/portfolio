updated portfolio week-8 assignment

## Summary
This site is my personal portfolio site that tells the viewer a little bit about me and my three top coding projects that I have worked on since I started this course.
These projects include my first group project of the course as well as two exemplary assignments: both highlight my javascript skills and the weather dashboard showcase my UI design skills in addition to the javascript.

### How to navigate the site
The site consists of a navbar that contains anchor links to the relevant sections of the page. The portfolio is two main sections. the About section contains a picture of me. Below the picture navlinks to my github and linkedin profiles the third link is to a pdf of my resume generated by linkedin.  my email address and phone number are presented followed by a short bio. The projects section iniitially consists of nav pills that show the three projects that I selected to showcase. The user should click on these links which will reveal a carousel showing snapshots of the project in question as well as links to the deployed site and the github repo link.

### Design
The site utilises the bootstrap framework and I got a lot of my inspiration from the material ui kit by Creative Tim
[https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit]
The site is responsive and utilises a bit of javascript to assist in the responsiveness
